            Our proposed home automation system consists of a web server,wifi technology and ,hardware interface modules which will be connected with the sensors and actuators will be responsible for the working of the appliances.

So our system works in a  way such that we have a web server at the center which is nothing but a PC with built in wifi cards
We will be able to remotely access the web server through a PC or handheld mobile devices connected to the internet with appropriate web browser support .The 
wifi technology will be the link between the hardware interface modules and the web server.The hardware interface modules will be directly connected to the sensor and actuators through wired connection.
The main task of the server will be to manage the hardware interface modules about when to execute their tasks thorough actuator and report back to the server through sensorsThe whole system will be overlooked by an administrator, he will also be responsible to check the credentials entered by the user at the front end.If the credentials are valid then the user will be able to access the system or else he will be blocked out of the system completely until he enters valid credential details. </p>
