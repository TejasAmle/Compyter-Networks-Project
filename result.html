                So our project proposes a low cost , secured, remotely accessible configurable Home Automation System
                The objectives discussed earlier were targeted one by one and we were successful in building a
                simulation based on wifi technology satisfying user needs and requirements.
                WiFi technology has proved to be an effective solution to built a remotely accessible system which is
                secure and has helped in reducing the costs then the previously existing systems
                We were also able to implement it in the real life where we were able to control light using a wifi
                based system.
                The system layout and architecture were also discussed and implemented in the project
                The proposed system is also better in the form of flexibility and scalability then the existing systems
                Hence we can conclude that the required goals and objectives of our wifi based home automation system
                have been achieved.
